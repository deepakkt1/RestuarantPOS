# CodingExerciseSubmission

I am Deepak, a graduate student from University of Colorado Boulder pursuing Master's in Computer Science. I developed a web application to help Servers in the restuarant 'The Greasy Spoon' manage checks. This application uses Avero POS API to communicate with server and get relevant information. 

In order to run this web application, clone the repository. For example if your path is /var/www/html, ensure the folder structure is as following:


/var/www/html/index.html

/var/www/html/test.php

/var/www/html/images


For the application to run, you need apache and php installed. More details on how to install them can be found here for [Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-16-04) , [Windows](https://www.znetlive.com/blog/how-to-install-apache-php-and-mysql-on-windows-10-machine/) and [Mac](https://jason.pureconcepts.net/2016/09/install-apache-php-mysql-mac-os-x-sierra/)

### NOTE: The webpage has a GIF in center which acts as home button. While browsing checks, each item having table and check number is collapsable with the required details.
